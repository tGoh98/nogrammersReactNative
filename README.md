## How to run
Setting up the environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup  

### Metro + simulator
1. Start the metro server `npx react-native start`
2. In another terminal window, run either `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android`  
* Note that for an android run, you need to have a simulator already running

### Expo
It's not that easy rip you have to create a new Expo project then copy everything over  
https://docs.expo.io/introduction/faq/?redirected
